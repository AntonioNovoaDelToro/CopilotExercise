<!-- 
I want a homepage to be displayed here. With a centered h1 tag that says "Upload your CSV file:" 
below that, I want a file upload component that allows the user to upload a CSV file using drag and drop. It could accept
only CSV files. Below that, I want a button that says "Upload" that will upload the file to the server.
and a SurveyPrompt component below it. 
Build the homepage now
